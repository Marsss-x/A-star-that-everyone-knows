THE STAR THAT EVERYONE KNOWS
I ’ve known you for a long time 
My heart has seen you go and come
You take your light from us in the night 
And you’ve taken it from us in the day
My heart has seen your power
And my heart has worshiped you

My heart understands you,
You’re not a god
While my heart has come and go,
You’ve always remained
You’ve never taken your light
My heart knows it was the moon who blocked your light
When you’re disturbed, your wind sends charged particles to me
They ride my force field until they find the weakest points
Then they collide with molecules in my atmosphere and heat them up 
Aurora visits then,
Her beauty, a sort of apology letter for the storm you caused
I’ve moved around you forever but I could never reach you
I’ve seen your crown forever but I could never touch it

But after 3 years,
After 7 tries,
Pushing past the extreme heat, the dust, the wind and the storms all caused by you
The 8th try brought my heart to you
With around 8.1 million miles to you,
My heart has reached you
You may not be a god but you are a star
You may not be be royalty but my heart has touched your crown
You are the star that everyone knows 
And I am the planet that my heart knows best
You are the sun
And I am the earth
My heart is my people 
And my heart has reached you
